        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <h4>
          "Small Enough to Serve, Large Enough to Supply" is much more than just
          a motto at Jefco Manufacturing, Inc.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Service, quality, and delivery are words that have lost a great deal
          of meaning over the years with many companies - not so with Jefco. In
          1938 our family started a small manufacturing company in Detroit, Mi.
          Through 4 generations and with over 80 years of experience Jefco Mfg.
          has grown by leaps and bounds to an industry leader.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our management, sales, engineering, and production departments all
          work hand in hand to keep up-to-date on new machinery and tooling
          capabilities as well as production rates. Doing so allows us to
          produce a high quality product at competitive pricing, in turn saving
          the customer time and money. In addition we also keep a stock of items
          at volumes that few firms can match, therefore being prepared to
          supply product quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With Jefco's state of the art equipment, machinery and extensive tool
          room facilities, we are capable of producing accurate and precise
          designs in short and long runs providing our customers with excellent
          quality, price and delivery. Our fully automatic, semi automatic, and
          CNC equipment allows us the versatility to supply both standard and
          custom hinges as well as other custom products.
        </p>

          We invite you to explore our website and online catalog. On our
          website we provide you with proper terminology, material sizes, and

          custom products. We are virtually capable of handling any material,
          gauge, pin size, width and length (within practical limits).

          If special hinges or products are required, please submit your prints
          or send us your samples for a prompt quoting. If pre-production design
          is required, our qualified engineering staff are on standby ready to
          assist you with drawings and samples to meet your approval. Our team
          of qualified & service-oriented professionals are available to assist
